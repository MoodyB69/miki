                There is no fixed definition of a classic car. They are usually older cars, typically 25 years or older, though definitions vary.[note 1] A common theme is of an older car of historical interest to be collectible and tend to be restored rather than scrapped, though sometimes age is not a factor. Classic cars are often considered a subset of a broader category of "collector cars" (which includes both restored classic cars vehicles and newer exotic vehicles). A subset of what is considered classic cars are known as antique cars (manufactured before 1980) or vintage cars (manufactured pre-World War II).<sup>[1]</sup>
            </p>
            <p>Organizations such as the Classic Car Club of America (CCCA) maintain lists of eligible unmodified cars that are called "classic". These are described as "fine" or "distinctive" automobile, either American or foreign built, produced between 1915 and 1948.</p>
            <p>Post-World War II "classic cars" are not precisely defined and the term is often applied to any older vehicle.</p>

            <h2>Recognition of Classic status</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Australia</h3>
            <p>Australia has two main classic car registration categories the Historic Vehicles Scheme (HVS) and the Classic Vehicle Scheme (CVS), the latter for vehicles over the age of 25 (or 30) yet feature modifications out of the range to be considered ‘Historic’. Under these categories owners are not required to pay the usual registration fees etc. however use of the vehicle registered under the scheme is restricted to a set limit per registration term.</p>
            <p>Most classic Ford Falcons, Chrysler Valiants and Holdens (alongside Toranas and Commodores) are on either of the registers, however it is not uncommon for these cars to end up with full registrations either.</p>
            <h3>Canada</h3>
            <p>The Vintage Car Club of Canada (VCCC) recognizes vehicles that are 25 years old and older.[2] The VCCC is one of the oldest collector car clubs in Canada. It has been a registered Society since the mid 1950s. Each year a different Chapter hosts the annual May Tour in a different geographical location in British Columbia. The VCCC has approximately 2800 members in BC counting spouses. The club has been a continuous member of the (NAACC) National Association of Automobile Clubs of Canada Corporation since 1971.<sup>[citation needed]</sup></p>
            <p>The National Association of Automobile Clubs of Canada (NAACC) recognizes stock and modified vehicles that are 20 years old and older. The National Association of Automobile Clubs of Canada is Federally incorporated as a 'not for profit' Corporation. Operational since 1970 it is one of the largest collector vehicle Associations in North America.[3] The NAACC is responsible for doing away with 'Duty' at the Canadian border. All vehicles and related parts that are 25 years old or older are 'Duty' free when entered into Canada. As of this writing the NAACC is represented in every Province in Canada. The Association sanctions two major Concours in Canada. The Cobble Beach Concours in Kemble Ontario (Owen Sound) and the Crescent Beach Concours on the west coast (Surrey BC) are sanctioned by the NAACC.<sup>[citation needed]</sup></p>
            <h3>United States</h3>
            <p>Cars produced in 1915 and older typically fall into the antique class and this includes the "Brass Era car" that are defined by the Horseless Carriage Club of America (HCCA) as "any pioneer gas, steam and electric motor vehicle built or manufactured prior to January 1, 1916."<sup>[4]</sup></p>
            <p>The "classic" term is often applied loosely by owners to any car that is more than 20 years old.<sup>[5]</sup></p>
            <p class="car-p">Legally, most states have time-based rules for the definition of "historic" or "classic" for purposes such as antique vehicle registration. For example, Maryland defines historic vehicles as 20 calendar years old or older and they "must not have been substantially altered, remodeled or remanufactured from the manufacturers original design"<sup>[6]</sup> while West Virginia defines motor vehicles manufactured at least 25 years prior to the current year as eligible for "classic" car license plates.<sup>[7]</sup></p>
            <p>Despite this, at many American classic car shows, automobiles typically range from the 1920s to the 1970s. Recently, many 1980s and even early 1990s cars are considered being "classic automobiles". Examples of cars at such shows include the Chevrolet Bel-Air, Ford Model T, Dodge Charger, Ford Deuce Coupe, and 1949 Ford. Meanwhile, the Concours d'Elegance car shows feature prestigious automobiles such as the Cadillac V16 or pre-1940 Rolls-Royce models. There are also terms as "modern customs", "exotics", or "collectibles" that cover cars such as the AMC Gremlin or Ford Pinto.</p>
            <p>There are differences in the exact identification of a "classic car". Division by separate eras include: horseless carriages (19th-century experimental automobiles such as the Daimler Motor Carriage), antique cars (brass era cars such as the Model T), and classic cars (typically 1930s cars such as the Cord 812). Some also include muscle cars, with the 1974 model year as the cutoff.
